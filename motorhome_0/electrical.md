How to configure multiple battery setup https://caravanchronicles.com/guides/how-to-connect-two-batteries-in-parallel/

* Series connection: Same capacity, increase in voltage  
  Connect the positive terminal of one battery to the negative terminal of the next battery. Repeat this connection pattern until all batteries are linked
* Parallel connection: Increase capacity, same voltage  
  Connect all positive terminals together and all negative terminals together.

## How much battery storage is required

https://12voltblog.com.au/how-much-power-does-12volt-stuff-use/  
Even large fridge/freezers are usually average around 100Ah per day.  
Microwaves draw a lot, 9.2Ah for 5 min usage.

12v Compressor Fridge

* SawaFuji compressor which is used in Engel fridges
  * Engel is a one-moving-part unit with the compressor’s piston being moved back and forth directly by electromagnets
  * There is no separate motor driving the compressor – the piston is the compressor and the motor all in one
* Danfoss or Secop compressor used in Waeco fridges and many other brands
  * Danfoss, or Secop compressor as it now is, uses a standard combination of an electric motor driving a compressor, contained in a sealed unit.  
    This standard arrangement has the advantage of being able to incorporate counter-balances within the motor-compressor which can help to reduce vibration and noise

Per day, + 20% = 500Ah

Fridge/Freezer ...................................... 100Ah  
2 ceiling fans on full 2Ah for 24 hours .. 96Ah  
TV ........................................................ 15Ah  
laptop ................................................... 100Ah  
Lights ................................................... 100Ah

provide enough energy in the battery to last 3 days https://12voltblog.com.au/how-to-find-the-right-size-12volt-battery/.  
So that's 1500Ah.

Each battery must have it's own management system (BMS)

Lithium or AGM Deep Cycle?

Option 3 here: https://www.rvwithtito.com/articles/how-much-does-rv-solar-cost/ is:

* 600-800 Ah of lithium batteries
* 800 to 1200 watts of solar panels
* 60 Amp MPPT Solar Charge Controller
* 3,000-4,000 watt hybrid inverter

Currently, I'm thinking aim for 900Ah of lithium, if we go AGM, we need double the capacity.

The place Reno got his batteries from has good deals. 12v 300Ah is under $2k each, so $6k for 900Ah, or 8 x 270Ah https://sunnytech.co.nz/store/default/product-details/119/69/88/0 which would be $4552
